# Demystifying Modern AI Papers with Matrix and Number Walkthroughs

An educational project that breaks down the complex mathematics behind cutting-edge AI research papers. Inspired by Prof. Tom Yeh’s `AI by Hand` approach, this project reconstructs key equations, matrix operations, and numerical steps — all visualized in interactive Excel sheets.

It’s designed for students, researchers, and enthusiasts who want to see how AI really works under the hood.
